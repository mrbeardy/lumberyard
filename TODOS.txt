  ☐ Physx - AddForce method
  ☐ Multiple asset browsers
  ☐ "Jump to asset" button. Will allow you to jump to the asset in the asset browser for the current Entity ID. Look at "Find slice in asset browser" for example code.
  ☐ "Use selected asset" button. Uses the selected asset in the asset browser and fills it into an Entity ID field.
  ☐ "Play from here". Starts the game with the player at the current position. The game doesn't really have a concept of a "player", or "player start" like UE, so maybe we can specify what Entity should be teleported, then simply add that as an entity in the world when the level loads. Then that simply sets the position of the entity to its current position.
  ☐ "Move selected entity to current positon" right-click option. Moves whatever objects you have selected to the current camera viewport camera position.
  - Viewport:
    ☑ Maya navigation setting
    ☐ Outline selected entity
    ☑ Scroll-wheel while holding right click increases/decreases camera speed
    ☑ "Don't invert pan during rotation" setting - "Invert pan" option works perfectly, but holding alt to rotate around object is also inverted.
    ☐ Only show gizmo on last-selected entity
    ☐ Add action for "Focus on active" -  Currently "focus on selected" will focus on the center of all selected entities, which is great, but sometimes not what I want.
    ☐ Timer on Right-click to show context menu to avoid it popping up if mouse doesn't move
